1. Requirements analysis:  this  stage  includes  the  communication  with  the  customer  to
clarify  his  needs,  and  an  analysis  stage  to  sketch  out  the  main  behaviour  of  the
application. It can be divided into two stages:
Requirements  specification:  the  communication  with  the  customer,  in  which  we
will arrange some interviews or other ways of getting information. We must clarify
the needs to be fulfilled, and once the requirements have been gathered, we write a
document called requirements specification, that must be as complete as possible.
Analysis: from the  requirements  specification created in  previous  stage,  we  must
now create a new document where we will use some helpful diagrams to represent
the main functionalities of the application and their connections or dependencies.

2. Design:  from  the  analysis  documents  set  before,  we  can  now  determine  how  the
software  will  work.  Here  we  will  use  other  diagrams  that  will  help  us  implement  the
software.

3. Implementation:  this  stage  should  be  started  from  previous  design  stage,  using  a
specific programming language (or more than one).

4. Testing: once the product has been implemented, we must test it to check if it fulfills all
the  requirements and there is no bug. These tests  should be checked by someone not
involved in the implementation process.

5. Maintenance:  this last  stage  consists  in  improving  the  performance  of  the  software
product, by adding new extensions, or fixing some bugs
