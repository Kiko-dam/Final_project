Source  code  editor:  This  is  an  essential  part  of  every  IDE,  since  it  lets  us  write the
source  code  of  our program.  It usually highlights the  code  syntax,  and may  also have
some additional features,  such as  code autocompletion, auto indentation,  context help,
access to API documentation, auto insertion of parentheses, square brackets...

Compilers: This tool is in charge of translating our source code into machine code. Some
IDEs lets us add many different compilers for many different languages, as we will see
later.

Interpreters: It is also possible that our IDE uses some kind of virtual machine, in case
our  programming  language  needs  it.  So,  the  executable  will  not  be  run  from  the
processor, but from an intermediate virtual machine.

Debugger:  It  is  in  charge  of  debugging  our  source  code.  In  other  words,  it  lets us
examine  step  by  step the  execution  of  our  program,  check the  values  of the  different
variables and stop the program at any point.

GUI builder: It simplifies the creation of graphical user interfaces, so that we can place
the different controls (buttons, lists, menus...) wherever we want.

Version control: With version control tools we can manage every change in the source
code of our projects, so that we will have different versions of each source file, and we
can  go  back  and  recover  any  older  version  at  any  time.  It  is  an  essential  tool  for
teamwork.
