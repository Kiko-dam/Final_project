Introduction

A  development  environment  is  a  set  of  processes  and  programming  tools  that  we  use  to
create software. An integrated develoment environment or IDE is an environment in which
processes  and  tools  are  coordinated,  and  they  provide  an  ordered  interface,  and  some
suitable views for the software development process (or, at least, for writing the code, test it
and pack it).

The first IDEs were born at the beginning of the 70s, but they became really popular along
the 90s. Their first aim is to save time and have more reliability in software processes. They
provide the programmer some useful components that increase the efficiency and reduce the
coding time.

Some examples of these IDEs are Geany, Visual Studio Code, NetBeans, Eclipse... In this unit
we are going to focus on the first two, since they are general purpose environments, this is,
they can be used for many different programming languages.
