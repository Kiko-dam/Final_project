If we look for the definition of software on the Internet, we can find some of them, although
they are basically the same. We call software the set of programs, documentation and data
related with a computer system.
Each  software product is  (or  can be) different from the  rest, because it is developed for a
different customer, or to fulfill a different purpose. So, developing this product implies some
previous steps: understand what we have to do, make a previous design and implement it, as
we  will  see  later.  Therefore,  we  can't  compare  software  development  with  industrial
production (such as keyboard manufacturing, for instance), where everything is much more
automated. Software development requires the creation of a software project, and a group of
people working in a coordinated way. Besides, software does not break along time, although
its performance can be reduced because of its own updates and improvements.

1.1.1. Software components

From previous definition of software, we can figure out that it is composed of three elements:
- Programs: sets of instructions that provide the desired functionality. They are written in
a specific programming language.
- Data:  programs  need  data  to  work  with.  These  data  can  be  retrieved  and/or  stored
from/in databases or files.
- Documentation: software documents explain how to use it, which elements are part of
it and how they are interconnected, so that it can be updated or fixed in the future.
