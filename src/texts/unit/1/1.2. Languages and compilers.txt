We  have  seen  that  programs  are  sets  of  instructions  that  are  provided  to  a  computer  to
complete a task. These instructions are written in a programming language of our  choice,
and this way we create some text files called source code, written in the chosen language.

1.1.2. Language types

When  we want  to  choose  a  specific programming  language,  we  distinguish  between  high
level languages  (close  to  human  language,  and  so,  easier  to  understand  by  the
programmers),  and  low  level languages  (close  to  machine  language,  and  so,  harder  to
understand by the programmers, but more efficient).
- We  have  a  wide  variety  of high level languages to  choose,  depending  on the type  of
application that we want to implement. We can talk about C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript,
PHP, Python, etc.
- Among low level languages, maybe the most popular one is the assembly language, a
very concrete set of instructions that are easily translated into machine language.
