1.1.3. C language

If we have to define in a few words what C language is, maybe the most suitable definition
would  be  the  language,  because  most  of  current  languages  are  based  on  it.  In  fact,  C
language is an evolution of an older language, called B, but it was not so popular.
Before C language  arrived, programmers used  some  kind of physical devices to implement
their  programs,  such  as  perforated  cards,  or  in  the  best  case,  some  assembly,  low  level
language, hard to understand, write and maintain.
Therefore, we can figure out that the arrival of C language in the beginning of the 70s was a
complete success. Despite being a language with high level structures, it also has some low
level features, such as direct memory control through pointers.
Nowadays, C language is not very popular when building applications, but it is still used for
developing  operating  systems,  libraries  and  some  tools  such  as  compilers  for  other
languages. It is very appreciated because of the efficiency of its code.
